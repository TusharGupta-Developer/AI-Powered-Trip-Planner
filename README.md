# 🌍 Wanderly – AI-Powered Trip Planner 🚀  

I am currently developing **Wanderly**, an **AI-powered** and **stylish** trip planning application. My goal is to combine **React**, **Gemini AI**, **Firebase**, and **Tailwind CSS** to create a **smart travel assistant** that simplifies trip planning while enhancing my skills as a developer.

## 🚀 Project Status: Completed ✅ | 🚧 Ongoing Enhancements

The project is fully functional and completed, but we’re actively working on performance improvements and feature enhancements.

---

### 🔧 Recent Updates
- Blocked costly Place Photo API calls (billing issue) and switched to Gemini AI–generated images.  
- Replaced invalid AI-generated image links with static images from the public folder.  
- Created a new Google Cloud billing project, enabled Places API, and updated the API key.  
- ✅ Places Autocomplete is now working seamlessly in both local and deployed environments.  

---

### 🚀 Upcoming Enhancements
- Optimize the `useEffect` loop with proper dependency handling to prevent redundant API calls.  
- Re-enable the `/create-trip`, `/create-trip/view-trip/:tripId`, and `/my-trip` routes after API optimizations.  
- Refine UI/UX and reduce unnecessary re-renders for smoother performance.

💡 **Note:** All core features are functional — current work focuses on cost optimization, efficiency, and user experience.
