## üöÄ Project Status: Completed ‚úÖ | üöß Ongoing Enhancements

The core product is complete and fully functional. Current work focuses on **cost optimization**, **performance**, and **UX**‚Äînot blocking core feature usage.

### Recent updates
- Blocked high-cost Place Photo API calls (billing issue) and switched to Gemini-assisted image generation + local fallbacks.
- Replaced invalid AI-generated image links with curated images from `/public`.
- Created a new Google Cloud billing project, enabled Places API, and updated the API key.
- Restored **Places Autocomplete** in both local and production environments.
- Started defensive changes to `useEffect` hooks and network guards to avoid repeated requests.

### Upcoming enhancements
- Re-enable temporarily-commented routes after API usage is guarded.
- Optimize re-renders (memoization, `useMemo`, `React.memo`).
- Add loading skeletons, empty states, and better error handling for missing API keys.

> **Note:** Core app features (Autocomplete, itinerary generation, trip creation/viewing) are usable ‚Äî enhancements aim to make them robust and production-cost-safe.
